<h3>Dictionary</h3>
<br/>
A Python dictionary is data structure that lets the programmer map a key to a value.
Just like with a real dictionary, you define a set of terms. Each term has a single definition.
Terms or keys may be any data type, such as a string, int, or number. Definitions or values may be any type or object.
<br/>
For example, take the following defined terms.
<br/>

    cow - four legged bovine, vegan, sometimes spotted
    cat - four legged feline, omnivore, usually furry, meows alot
    bird - winged creature, noisy, tweets constantly

<br/>
A Python dictionary version of these terms will look something like this.
<br/>
<pre>
    animals = {
        'cow': 'four legged bovine, vegan, sometimes spotted',
        'cat': 'four legged feline, omnivore, usually furry, meows alot',
        'bird': 'winged creature, noisy, tweets constantly'
    }

    >>> print(animals)
    {'cat': 'four legged feline, omnivore, usually furry, meows alot', 'cow': 'four legged bovine, vegan, sometimes spotted', 'bird': 'winged creature, noisy, tweets constantly'}
</pre>
<br/>
To find the definition or value of a particular term or key, you may reference the key using the square brackets.
This looks similar to the way we referenced items in a list or letters in a string. To find the value of 'cow' we
reference 'cow' in animals.
<br/>

<pre>
    >>> animals['cow']

    four legged bovine, vegan, sometimes spotted
</pre>

<br/>
If we pass in a key that doesn't exist in a dictionary we see a KeyError.
<br/>

<pre>
    >>> animals['dog']

    Traceback (most recent call last):
        globals = debugger.run(setup['file'], None, None, is_module)
      File "/Applications/PyCharm Edu.app/Contents/helpers/pydev/pydevd.py", line 1771, in run
        pydev_imports.execfile(file, globals, locals)  # execute the script
      File "/Applications/PyCharm Edu.app/Contents/helpers/pydev/_pydev_imps/_pydev_execfile.py", line 18, in execfile
        exec(compile(contents+"\n", file, 'exec'), glob, loc)
        print(animals['dog'])
    KeyError: 'dog'
</pre>

<br/>
We can create dictionaries as we did above with animals. We might also want to create an empty dictionary and add
values to it throughout our program.
<br/>

<pre>
    >>> animals = {}

    >>> animals['dog'] = 'not a cat, a cow, or a bird, barks a lot'

    >>> animals['dog']

    'not a cat, a cow, or a bird, barks a lot'
</pre>

<br/>
Using an if statement and a comparison we can check to see if a key exists in a dictionary.
<br/>

<pre>
    animals = {}

    animals['dog'] = 'not a cat, a cow, or a bird, barks a lot'

    if 'cat' in animals:
        print('cat -', animals['cat'])
    else:
        print('no cat for us')

    if 'dog' in animals:
        print('dog -', animals['dog'])
    else:
        print('no dog for us')

    no cat for us
    dog - not a cat, a cow, or a bird, barks a lot
</pre>

<br/>
Finally, we can iterate or loop through dictionaries. Unlike lists, dictionaries are not sorted in any particular order.
They are mainly intended to be used with keys.
<br/>

<pre>
    animals = {
        'cow': 'four legged bovine, vegan, sometimes spotted',
        'cat': 'four legged feline, omnivore, usually furry, meows alot',
        'bird': 'winged creature, noisy, tweets constantly'
    }

    for k, v in animals.items():
        print(k,' - ',v)
        if k == 'cat':
            print('meow')

    cat  -  four legged feline, omnivore, usually furry, meows alot
    meow
    bird  -  winged creature, noisy, tweets constantly
    cow  -  four legged bovine, vegan, sometimes spotted
</pre>

<br/>
If you do need to sort a dictionary you may use the sorted() function.
<br/>

<pre>
    for k, v in sorted(animals.items()):
        print(k,' - ',v)
        if k == 'cat':
            print('meow')

    bird  -  winged creature, noisy, tweets constantly
    cat  -  four legged feline, omnivore, usually furry, meows alot
    meow
    cow  -  four legged bovine, vegan, sometimes spotted
</pre>
