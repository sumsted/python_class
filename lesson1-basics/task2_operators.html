Operators are symbols we use to perform arithmetic on numbers in Python. Some operators may also be used to manipulate strings or words or other objects.
<br/>
Here are a few examples of arithmetic operators. The examples below use ints. If using ints in operations you will usually receive ints as the result, but in Python 3 the / division operator will return a float.
<pre>
    >>> 4 + 3
    7
    
    >>> 4 * 3
    12
</pre><br/>
The result of 10 divided by 3 gives you a float or floating point number.
<pre>
    >>> 10 / 3
    3.3333333333333335
</pre><br/>
//  floor division operator, the result has no decimal component. It will return an int.
<pre>
    >>> 10 // 3
    3
</pre><br/>
**  power operator
<pre>
    >>> 3**2   
    9
</pre><br/>
Placing a - minus sign in front of a number makes it negative. The minus sign by itself is called a negative unary operator because it only needs one number to perform a calculation. There's also a positive or + plus sign unary operator, but you'll likely never use it. 
<pre>
    >>> -4
    -4
    
    >>> -(4-5)
    1
    
    >>> +4
    4
    
    >>> +(4-5)
    -1
</pre>
