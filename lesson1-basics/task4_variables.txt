Variables

You've seen a few variables in the previous exercises.
Variables are labels or tags or names that you can assign to a number or to a math operation. They let you store a number or result to use later in your program.
    >>> some_number = 4

    >>> some_number
    4

    >>> result = some_number * 8

    >>> result
    32

    >>> radius = 5

    >>> pi = 3.14159

    >>> area = pi * radius**2

    >>> area
    78.53975
