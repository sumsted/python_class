<h3>Lists</h3>
A list in Python is grouping or collection of objects, such as a colelction of strings. For example you could have a list that looks like this:<br/>
<pre>
    pokemon = ["Bulbasaur", "Squirtle", "Charmander"]
</pre><br/>
You might also have a list of numbers, like this:<br/>
<pre>
    ages = [10, 13, 20, 5]
</pre><br/>
You can pull individual items from a list using  [ ] square brackets, passing in the index of the value you would like returned. As with strings this index begins at 0.<br/>
<pre>
    ages[0]
    10

    pokemon[2]
    'Charmander'
</pre><br/>
We'll study lists more when we look at loops in the next lesson.
