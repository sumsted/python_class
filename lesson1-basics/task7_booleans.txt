Booleans

Think of a boolean as True or False, yes or no. Booleans can be identified using comparison operators.
    ==   !=   <   >   <=   >=

    >>> small = 3

    >>> small == 3
    True

    >>> small == 4
    False

    >>> large = 5

    >>> small == large
    False

    >>> small > large
    False

    >>> small < large
    True

    >>> small <= large
    True

    >>> small >= large
    False

    >>> small != large
    True

You may assign a boolean value like True or False to a variable.
    >>> b = True

    >>> b == True
    True

    >>> b == False
    False

There are some special boolean operations in python.
    >>> 'J' in 'Jack'
    True

    >>> 'J' not in 'Jack'
    False

    >>> 'k' not in 'Jack'
    False

The and operator will return true if the comparisons on both sides are True. The or operator will return true if one of the two comparisons surrounding it is True.
    >>> x = 3
    >>> y = 4

    >>> x == 3 and y == 5
    False

    >>> x == 3 or y == 5
    True
