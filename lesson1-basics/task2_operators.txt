Operators are symbols we use to perform arithmetic on numbers in Python. Some operators may also be used to manipulate strings or words or other objects.
Here are a few examples of arithmetic operators. The examples below use ints. If using ints in operations you will usually receive ints as the result, but in Python 3 the / division operator will return a float.
    >>> 4 + 3
    7

    >>> 4 * 3
    12

The result of 10 divided by 3 gives you a float or floating point number.
    >>> 10 / 3
    3.3333333333333335

// floor division operator, the result has no decimal component. It will return an int.
    >>> 10 // 3
    3

** power operator
    >>> 3**2
    9

Placing a - minus sign in front of a number makes it negative. The minus sign by itself is called a negative unary operator because it only needs one number to perform a calculation. There's also a positive or + plus sign unary operator, but you'll likely never use it.
    >>> -4
    -4

    >>> -(4-5)
    1

    >>> +4
    4

    >>> +(4-5)
    -1
