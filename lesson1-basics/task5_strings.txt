Strings

Strings are a group of characters. A character could be a number, letter, or symbol like an operator or punctuation. Strings can also be made up of characters from other languages.
Strings are identifed either by ' ' single quotes or " " double quotes.
    >>> "what do you call someone with no nose and no body"
    'What do you call someone with no nose and no body?'

    >>> 'nobody knows'
    'nobody knows'

Strings may be stuck together to make bigger strings. This is called concatenation. Concatentation uses the + plus operator.
    >>> 'Big' + ' ' + 'Ben'
    'Big Ben'

Having the option of a single or double quote let's you easily add single or double quotes to your string.
    >>> "Joe's car"
    "Joe's car"

    >>> 'John said, "Get off your horse and drink your milk!"'
    'John said, "Get off your horse and drink your milk!"'

Variables can also hold strings.
    >>> first_name = 'Steve'

    >>> last_name = 'Martin'

    >>> full_name = first_name + ' ' + last_name

    >>> full_name
    'Steve Martin'

You may use the multiply operator to create a long string from a small one.
    >>> short_name = "three "

    >>> short_string = "three "

    >>> long_string = short_string * 3

    >>> long_string
    'three three three '

You may use formatting to create a larger string.
    >>> "four : %d" % 4
    'four : 4'

You may pull individual letters from strings by adding [ ] square brackets to the end of the string and specifying the position of the character that you want to pull between the brackets. The first position is 0.
    >>> name = "Jack"

    >>> name[0]
    'J'

    >>> name[1]
    'a'

    >>> name[2]
    'c'

    >>> name[3]
    'k'
