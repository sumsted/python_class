<h3>Order of operations</h3>
You are probably familiar with order of operations. Python follows order of operations.
<br/>
For example:
<br/>
Here 3 * 5 is calculated before 2 is added to it.<br/>
<pre>
    >>> 2 + 3 * 5
    17
</pre><br/>
2 to the 3rd power is calculated before 5 is multiplied to the result.<br/>
<pre>
    >>> 2**3 * 4
    32

    >>> 12.56 / 2**2
    3.14

    >>> 2 * 3 - 4 / 2
    4.0
</pre><br/>
You may use parentheses to group operations, overriding normal order.<br/>
<pre>
    >>> (2 + 4) * 3
    18

    >>> (4 * 2)**2
    64

    >>> (9  + 3) * (9 + 6)
    180
</pre><br/>
Order of operations is:
<pre>
    +-(unary)  ** ()   *   /   //   +  -
</pre>
