<h3>Booleans</h3>
Think of a boolean as True or False, yes or no. Booleans can be identified using comparison operators.<br/>
<pre>
    ==   !=   <   >   <=   >=

    >>> small = 3

    >>> small == 3
    True

    >>> small == 4
    False

    >>> large = 5

    >>> small == large
    False

    >>> small > large
    False

    >>> small < large
    True

    >>> small <= large
    True

    >>> small >= large
    False

    >>> small != large
    True
</pre><br/>
You may assign a boolean value like True or False to a variable.<br/>
<pre>
    >>> b = True

    >>> b == True
    True

    >>> b == False
    False
</pre><br/>
There are some special boolean operations in python.<br/>
<pre>
    >>> 'J' in 'Jack'
    True

    >>> 'J' not in 'Jack'
    False

    >>> 'k' not in 'Jack'
    False
</pre><br/>
The and operator will return true if the comparisons on both sides are True. The or operator will return true if one of the two comparisons surrounding it is True.<br/>
<pre>
    >>> x = 3
    >>> y = 4

    >>> x == 3 and y == 5
    False

    >>> x == 3 or y == 5
    True
</pre>
