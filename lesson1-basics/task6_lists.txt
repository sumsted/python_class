Lists

A list in Python is grouping or collection of objects, such as a colelction of strings. For example you could have a list that looks like this:
    pokemon = ["Bulbasaur", "Squirtle", "Charmander"]

You might also have a list of numbers, like this:
    ages = [10, 13, 20, 5]

You can pull individual items from a list using [ ] square brackets, passing in the index of the value you would like returned. As with strings this index begins at 0.
    ages[0]
    10

    pokemon[2]
    'Charmander'

We'll study lists more when we look at loops in the next lesson.
