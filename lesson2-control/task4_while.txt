while Loop

If you need repeatedly run a code block use a loop. Like the if statement the while loop uses a comparison. If the comparison is True the code block will continue to run.
    some_number = 0
    while some_number < 100:
        some_number = some_number + 10
        print('some_number is less than 100', some_number)
    print('some_number is now', some_number)
