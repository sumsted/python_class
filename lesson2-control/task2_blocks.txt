Code Blocks

Python is an indented language. What this means is that sections of code that we run begin and end with an indentation. Python code blocks are typically indented with 4 spaces. Blocks of code can be found in functions, classes, if, while and for loops.
Consider this code.
    print("I'm out of a code block")
    if True:
        print("I'm in a block")
        number = 4
        print(number * 3)
    print("I'm out of a code block")

There is a code block after the if statement.
