<h3>for Loop</h3>
Another type of loop is the for loop. The for loop does not use a comparison like the while loop. The for loop is useful when you would like to use a counter in your code block. Also useful if you would like to pull individual values from a list or collection into your code block. This is called iteration.
<br/>
You can use the range() function to count numbers.
<br/>
<pre>
    sum = 0
    for number in range(10):
        sum = sum + number
        print('number',number,'sum',sum)

    number 0 sum 0
    number 1 sum 1
    number 2 sum 3
    number 3 sum 6
    number 4 sum 10
    number 5 sum 15
    number 6 sum 21
    number 7 sum 28
    number 8 sum 36
    number 9 sum 45
</pre>
<br/>
For loops can walk through a list.
<br/>
<pre>
    names = ['Steve', 'Ned', 'Klaus', 'Jane']
    for name in names:
        if name == 'Klaus':
            print('Bye',name)
        else:
            print('Hi',name)

    Hi Steve
    Hi Ned
    Bye Klaus
    Hi Jane
</pre>
