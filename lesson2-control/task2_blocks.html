<h3>Code Blocks</h3>
Python is an indented language. What this means is that sections of code that we run begin and end with an indentation. Python code blocks are typically indented with 4 spaces. Blocks of code can be found in functions, classes, if, while and for loops.

Consider this code.<br/>
<pre>
    print("I'm out of a code block")
    if True:
        print("I'm in a block")
        number = 4
        print(number * 3)
    print("I'm out of a code block")
</pre>
There is a code block after the if statement.
